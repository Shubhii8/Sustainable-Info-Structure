            <h2>Lesson Overview</h2>
            <p>This lesson is meant for students who must begin research in their first semester of the TCID, IA, or the Ph.D. in Technical Communication program who want to develop, improve, or refresh their research skills. Additionally, this lesson is designed to give students strategies that will help them research more efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the <a href="https://hawkcard.iit.edu" target="_blank">Hawk Card Homepage</a>. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>

            <p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan.</p>

            <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
            <p>Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="illustrations/research2.jpg" alt="Library Services Icon on myIIT website">
                <figcaption>The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information. Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand navigation bar. The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>

            <h2>Research Timelines</h2>
            <h3>Formulating a Timeline</h3>
            <p>It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:</p>
            <p><em>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project < Remaining time before deadline</em></p>

            <h3>Let's unpack some of those terms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? -or- How long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource?</li>
                <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where you must begin to write if you want to finish on time?</li>
                <li><strong>Time to integrate resource into your project:</strong> Even if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to incorporate that information into your project?</li>
                <li><strong>Remaining time before deadline:</strong> How much time is left before you must turn in your project?</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="sidebar">
                <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
                <p>Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research timeline.</p>
                </aside>
    
                <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
                <p>Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research paper for a graduate course. She's decided to research the development of technical communication as a field between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II.</p>
                <p>Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching for articles using scholarly databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to her search topic, but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
                <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
                <p>Occasionally you will notice that some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine. Clicking on the Get Article link will direct you to a page where you can retrieve the article through another website or request the article through your myILL account.</p>
    
                <figure>
                    <img src="illustrations/research4_image2.jpg" alt="MyILL Article Request Page showing options to request an article">
                    <figcaption>For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL.</figcaption>
                </figure>
    
                <p>Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account, so you will need to register before you are able to request an article.</p>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Local Libraries</h2>
                <p>There are two types of local libraries that may contain your resources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Other university libraries belonging to I-Share</li>
                    <li>Public libraries</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>I-Share Libraries</h3>
                <p>Many I-Share libraries will allow you to pull books directly from the shelf and check them out instantaneously so long as you can present your IIT ID card. Daley Library at UIC, for example, has an open stacks policy. Not all area libraries belong to the I-Share system (e.g., Loyola and the University of Chicago).</p>
    
                <aside class="sidebar">
                    <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
                    <p>Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to find out it is closed for break or you are not allowed to browse the stacks as a non-student. When in doubt, call first.</p>
                </aside>
            </section>
    
            <section>
                <h2>Internet Resources</h2>
                <p>If you can obtain the same resource online, why request it? Some resources that are available online include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public domain writings</li>
                    <li>Resources licensed under Creative Commons</li>
                    <li>Media files such as video, audio, and images</li>
                </ul>
    
                <aside class="sidebar">
                    <h3>Being Realistic</h3>
                    <p>If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication, try searching for a special issue, yearbook, or edited volume on your topic. Collections like these offer a wealth of resources and represent a snapshot of collective scholarship on a topic.</p>
                </aside>
    
                <h3>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h3>
                <p>Near the completion of her research project, Bridgette starts to question some of the arguments in a central article in her paper. She wants to see if other researchers have included atypical examples of technical writing instruction. Thinking most articles written on this topic will have referenced the Connors article, she types the title into Google Scholar. She notices that Connors' article has been cited 62 times. From there, she searches the articles that cite Connors' article for the examples she is looking for.</p>

                <h2>That's It!</h2>
                <p>Hopefully, you learned a little bit about conducting research and obtaining resources. Remember, if you start researching early enough, you are not limited to only those resources that you can find online. Now that you have read these suggestions for researching, please take a short quiz to help you retain some key points from this lesson.</p>
